---

A deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant from dermoscopic images. 
This project includes preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.

---


##  Project Overview
Biomedical image segmentation plays a crucial role in **healthcare and research** by enabling precise identification of cell structures and medical regions of interest.  

In this project, we:  
- Built a custom CNN architecture for image classification.  
- Trained on skin lesion datasets  
- Achieved strong prediction accuracy on malignant vs. benign images
- Visualized training curves, evaluation metrics, and predictions
- Added support for new image inference

---

##  Features

✔️ CNN-based binary classifier

✔️ Image preprocessing + augmentation

✔️ Accuracy, Precision, Classification Report , Confusion matrix.. 

✔️ Dropout & BatchNorm for overfitting control

✔️ Predicts cancer type for new images

---

##  Dataset(Kaggle)
- Works with dermoscopic medical images (ISIC or similar datasets).
- Images are cleaned, resized, and normalized before training.
- Can be replaced with any medical image dataset for classification tasks.
- Supports both color and grayscale biomedical images.
